Github update process
git add -A; git commit -m "Development Update"; git push origin main

Start website on local machine: 
    1. run app.py (check JSON response only, cause front end will fetch API from render's endpoint, 
       so need to push to Git or else updates won't show on website)
    2. Start react
        cd "Frontend\frontend-setup"
        npm start 


If there are changes to backend, re-deploy Render
If there are changes to frontend's asset or added pages, re-deploy Vercel
