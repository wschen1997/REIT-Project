Auth issue to resolve: 
If a user half sign-up using traditional method, back out, try to use the same email again (trad method), it'll fail,
they can use gmail signup the second time with the same email, the traditional auth will be overwritten
And half sign-up using gmail does not prevent a second attempt using gmail, again, the auth will be overwritten.
